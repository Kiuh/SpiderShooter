# ***SpiderShooter***
## _SpiderShooter_ is a "sci-fi-ish" multiplayer shooter game prototype. This game is designed for 8 players. 
## _SpiderShooter_  was created by 3 university students. Two of us didn't have any experience with unity before this project but we learned a lot during the two weeks we were making it.
## We managed to make a playable build which you can download and try out for yourself! The playable build consists of a gaming scene, and a rigged and animated spider model which can move, jump, shoot and die. 
## Controls: 
## - WSAD for walking 
## - LMB for shooting 
## - Spacebar for jumping
## - Del for death animation
